## Releasing

Merges to `main` automatically tag versions, release a manifest at that
tag, and update the `dev` manifest.

The Promote workflow can be run manually to promote any tag to another,
typically to promote `dev` to `stable`. It also runs twice a month.

package. In most cases the appropriate license file has been copied into the
Restyler sub-directory. In cases where it's not: patches welcome.
