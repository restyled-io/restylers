## Releasing

Merges to `main` automatically tag versions, release a manifest at that
tag, and update the `dev` manifest.

The Promote workflow can be run manually to promote any tag to another,
typically to promote `dev` to `stable`. It also runs twice a month.

## LICENSE

installed into the Docker images defined here are governed by their own
licenses.

For a detailed description of another project's rationale for this licensing
model, one with which I agree, see [here][level].
