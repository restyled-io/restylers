Hi there! We love to add new Restylers, and the process is designed to be very easy. You can even [do it yourself](https://github.com/restyled-io/restyled.io/wiki/Adding-a-Restyler) if you like. If you'd rather have someone on our team do it, that's fine too. In order to make that happen as quickly as possible, there is just a few things we'd need from you.

Please confirm the following:

- [ ] I have looked at the [list of existing restylers](https://docs.restyled.io/available-restylers/) and confirmed the one I want is not present
- [ ] I have used this tool locally, invoked via CLI, to reformat source files

And provide the following:

- **Auto-formatter name**:
- **Auto-formatter website**:
- **Languages and file extensions this auto-formatter operates on**:
- **Examples (or links to examples) of before-and-after formatted code**:

And answer the following:

- How is the tool distributed/installed?
- What is the most idiomatic way to invoke it?
- Does the tool support modifying files in place?
- If so, can it accept multiple files at once?
- If so, can you / should you separate files from other options with `--`?

Thanks!
