        "Voilà! In view, a humble vaudevillian veteran cast vicariously as both
        victim and villain by the vicissitudes of Fate. This visage, no mere veneer
        of vanity, is a vestige of the vox populi, now vacant, vanished. However, this
        valourous visitation of a bygone vexation stands vivified and has vowed to vanquish
        these venal and virulent vermin vanguarding vice and vouchsafing the violently
        vicious and voracious violation of volition! The only verdict is vengeance;
        a vendetta held as a votive, not in vain, for the value and veracity of such
        shall one day vindicate the vigilant and the virtuous. Verily, this vichyssoise
        of verbiage veers most verbose, so let me simply add that it's my very good
        honour to meet you and you may call me V.
