      victim and villain by the vicissitudes of Fate. This visage, no mere veneer
      of vanity, is a vestige of the vox populi, now vacant, vanished. However, this
      valourous visitation of a bygone vexation stands vivified and has vowed to vanquish
      these venal and virulent vermin vanguarding vice and vouchsafing the violently
      vicious and voracious violation of volition! The only verdict is vengeance;
      a vendetta held as a votive, not in vain, for the value and veracity of such
      shall one day vindicate the vigilant and the virtuous. Verily, this vichyssoise
      of verbiage veers most verbose, so let me simply add that it''s my very good
      honour to meet you and you may call me V.
